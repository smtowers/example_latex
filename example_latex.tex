\section{Introduction}

Here is where you would put your Introduction\footnote{This is an example of a footnote}.

Here is an example of a citation to the Lacum {\it et al} (2014) paper
that describes the seven key elements
of scientific paper~\cite{lacum2014teaching}.
Other papers on this theme are References~\cite{van2016scientific,seiradakis2018training}.

Here is an example of how to insert an extra positive (or negative)
vertical space in the text:
\vspace*{1cm}

This space is separated 1cm below the preceding line.

Here is an example of how to insert an extra positive (or negative) horizontal \hspace*{1cm} space in the text.

\section{Methods and Materials}
\subsection{Data}

If your analysis involves data, here is where you would thoroughly describe it.

This is an example of a bulletted itemized list:
\begin{itemize}
\item Item 1
\item Item 2
\item Item 3
\end{itemize}

Here is an example of an enumerated itemized list:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Item 1
\item Item 2
\item Item 3
\end{enumerate}

Here is an example of an descriptive itemized list:
\begin{enumerate}
\item[Item 1:] describe item 1
\item[Item 2:] describe item 2
\item[Item 3:] describe item 3
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Mathematical Model}
\label{sec:math_model}

If your analysis involves a mathematical model, here is where you would describe it.

This is an example of a set of equations:
\begin{eqnarray}
S^\prime & = & -\beta S I/N \nonumber \\
I^\prime & = & +\beta S I/N -\gamma I\nonumber \\
R^\prime & = & +\gamma I
\label{eqn:mymodel}
\end{eqnarray}
Here is an example of an inline equation $S^\prime = -\beta S I/N$.

Here is a reference to Equation~\ref{eqn:mymodel} in the text.  Note that when you
reference specific equations, tables, or paper sections in the text, you always 
capitalise those nouns.  Here is a reference to Section~\ref{sec:math_model}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Statistical methods}

If your analysis involves any kind of specialised statistical methodology, here is
where you would describe it.

To account for potential over-dispersion in count data involved our analyses, we utilized
Negative Binomial likelihood fits~\cite{lloyd2007maximum}. 
The probability mass function (PMF) of the Negative Binomial distribution for observing $k$
counts when $\lambda$ are expected is~\cite{lloyd2007maximum}
\begin{eqnarray}
f(k|\lambda,\alpha) & = &
{{\Gamma(\alpha+k)}\over{k! \Gamma(\alpha)}}
\left({{\lambda}\over{\lambda+\alpha}}\right)^k
\left(1+{{\lambda}\over{\alpha}}\right)^{-\alpha}
\hspace*{1cm} \lambda>0,\alpha>0,
\label{eqn:nb}
\end{eqnarray}
where $\alpha$ is the over-dispersion parameter.
The mean of the PMF is $\lambda$.
When $\alpha\rightarrow \infty$ the Poisson distribution is obtained, and when
$\alpha\rightarrow 0$ (i.e. highly over-dispersed data) 
the log-series distribution is obtained~\cite{lloyd2007maximum}.
The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) was used for selection of the appropriate 
model~\cite{akaike1974new}.

Given a set of $M$ observations of the number of
violent crimes per day, $k_i$, with $i=1,...,M$
the likelihood of the observations is
\begin{eqnarray}
{{\cal{L}}} & = & \prod_{i=1}^{M} f(k_i|\lambda(t_i),\alpha),
\label{eqn:like}
\end{eqnarray}
where $\lambda(t_i)$ is the expected number of counts on day $t_i$.
The best-fit model values
used in the calculation of the $\lambda(t_i)$ are the values that maximize this
likelihood~\cite{cowan1998statistical}.

\section{Results}

Here, without discussion, is where you present your results, either within a
paragraph, or as a figure, or a table.

Here is an example of a reference to Figure~\ref{fig:figure1} in the text.  Here
is an example to a reference to Table~\ref{tab:table1}, which is delimited by
vertical lines.  Table~\ref{tab:table2} is a rotated table in landscape format,
with every second line coloured blue to aid in readability.

The one standard deviation uncertainty in my data was~\StdDeviationOfData.
